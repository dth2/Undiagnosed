The naive method is to multiply incedence times average time to infection. Assuming random infections during the time between last test and diagnosis, the average time from infection to diagnosis in years is:\n<<>>=\nti <- with(msm,sort(infPeriod[!is.na(infPeriod) & infPeriod>0]))\nmean(ti/2)\n@\nwhich, accoarding tot the formula that we were given, leads to an estimate of\n<<>>=\nincidence <- mean(y,na.rm=TRUE)\nincidence * mean(ti/2)*12/3\n@\n\nHowever, though this is in the right ballpark, I can't seem to derive a theoretical basis for its use. If we assume that tehre are no changes in incidence, then the diagnosis counts are estimates of the incidence counts, and the number of undiagnosed infections can be estimated with \n$$\n\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} y \\sum_{i=0}^jP(D > j-i)\n$$\nwhere $y$ is the rate of infection, and $D$ is a random variable representing the probability that someone infected with HIV waits $D$ time intervals before being diagnosed. Using quarterly discrete time units, this yields\n<<>>=\nj <- 1000\nz <- 0\nfor(i in 1:j) z <- z + sum(pid((j-i+1):2000)) + .5*pid(j-i)\nz*incidence\n@\nwhich is consistant with our model based estimates, as the incidence did not drastically change.\n\nUsing the continuous time empirical distribution, and again assuming constant incidence, we get the following estimate for undiagnosed\n<<>>=\n#continuous density of time between infection and diagnosis\npi <- function(i){\n  sapply(i,function(ii){\n    ints <- ti[ti>=ii]\n    sum(1/ints)/length(ti)\n  })\n}\nuti <- unique(ti)\np<-pi(uti) * diff(c(0,uti))\ncs <- cumsum(p)\n#cdf of density\nqi <- function(u){\n  uind <- rev(which(uti<=u))[1]\n  if(is.na(uind))\n    return(0)\n  cs[uind]\n}\n\nn <- 10000\nm <- max(ti)\ns <- seq(from=0,to=m,length.out=n)\nl <- length(ti)\nv <- sum(sapply(s,function(x) (sum(1-qi(x)))))\nv * 4 * incidence / (n/m)\n@\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{document}",
