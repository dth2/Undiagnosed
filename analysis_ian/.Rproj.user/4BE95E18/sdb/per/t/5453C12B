The original paper by Bruce (1972) provides the results from the study. A number of calculators are now available for predicting V02max based on that and other follow-up studies. See, for example, http://www.brianmac.co.uk/bruce.htm for an example of such a calculator._\n\nQuestion 1\n-------------------------\n\n_Consider initially a model that includes only duration on the treadmill as a predictor of V02max._\n_(a) State your priors (explain your choices)._\n_(b) Using the priors you stated in the previous item, fit a Bayesian regression model in Jags and perform model checking/assessment. Obtain summaries of the posterior predictive distribution of V02max at durations 500, 747, and 930 seconds. [Note: make sure to assess convergence of the MCMC chains. If you find problems with convergence, address the issues using the strategies discussed in class (for example, centering the predictor, discarding an appropriate number of iterations for burn-in, etc).]_\n\n```{r}\n# Set up data\ntread <- read.csv('treadmill.csv', \n                  col.names=c('id','time','VO2','heartrate','age','height','weight'))\nstr(tread)\n\n# http://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/inlining-jags-models-in-r-scripts-for-rjags/\n```\n\n\nQuestion 2\n-------------------------\n_Repeat the analysis but incorporating all possible predictors. For your predictions, make sure to set values within the observed range of the predictors. Using the DIC statistic, which is the best model?_\n\nQuestion 3\n-------------------------\n_Using the package BMA, what would your final model be? Are there indications that a single model would adequately predict V02max? Or would you have improved prediction performance by accounting for model uncertainty?_\n\n",
