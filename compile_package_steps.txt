IN R (easiest in the directory containing the package folder, e.g. trunk)
**************

Test the code by sourcing files in HIVBackCalc/R before loading the package.

(This is obvious, but since the package compilation process takes time, don't forget to do this!)

Rerun inlinedocs to update help files:
library(inlinedocs)
package.skeleton.dx("cantrance") - or insert path to cantrance


**************
IN THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE PACKAGE FOLDER, e.g. trunk:
**************

R CMD INSTALL -l "/home/jbirnbau/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15" HIVBackCalc

** above path is whatever is returned by R when you type .libPaths()

R CMD build HIVBackCalc

** this step makes the .tar.gz file
** version number will reflect whatever's in the DECSRIPTION file

R CMD check HIVBackCalc_1.1.tar.gz

** insert whatever version we're on


**************
IN A NEW INSTANCE OF R, IN THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE .tar.gz FILE:
**************

install.packages("cantrance_1.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

library(cantrance)


**************
DEALING WITH VERSION CONTROL
**************

It is bad to have the whole 'trunk' folder under version control because recompiling the package deletes the cantrance.Rcheck folder, including its .svn folder. 

If it comes under version control and then gets recreated by a new package build, delete the local copy, and then do svn update. svn should check it out from the repo and stop complaining. 


**************
BUILDING FOR WINDOWS
**************

1) Make sure that your email is in the MAINTAINER section of the DESCRIPTION FILE
2) Open R in the directory containing the package folder, e.g. trunk
3) Type:

library(devtools) >>> install this package if you don't have it already
build_win(pkg='cantrance')

4) Wait for an email that will link to your Windows HIVBackCalc package .zip file build, and download it
5) Install it the same way as you do on Linux: 
In a new instance of R in the directory containing the .zip file, type:

install.packages("HIVBackCalc_1.1.zip", repos=NULL)
library(HIVBackCalc)
